- Displacement, $s$ is the distance travelled in a specific direction
- Speed, $x$ is the distance travelled per unit time, the rate of change of distance
- Velocity, $v$ is the speed of an object in a specific dierction, the rate of change of displacement.
- Acceleration, $a$ is the rate of change in velocity with time

## Equations

1. Velocity

$$
v = u + at
$$

2. Displacement

$$
s = \frac{1}{2}(u + v)t
$$

$$
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2
$$

3. Velocity

$$
v^2 = u^2 + 2as
$$

## Inertia

Inertia is the tendency for an object to maintain its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line.

- Newton's First Law of motion (Law of Inertia) states that every object continues in its state of rest or of uniform speed in a straight line unless acted upon by external force.

- Principle of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of a system is constant if no external force acts on the system.

- Newton's Second Law of motion

$$
\begin{align}
    a &\propto \frac{F}{m} \\
    F &\propto ma \\
    F &= kma \\
    F &= ma
\end{align}
$$

- Newton's Third Law of motion states that to every action there is an equal but opposite reaction.

- Impulse (change in momentum)

$$
Ft = mv - mu
$$

- Impulsive force (rate of change in momentum)

$$
F = \frac{mv - mu}{t}
$$

- A free falling object is an object falling under the force of gravity only, do not encounter air resistant/friction.

- Weight (N)

$$
w = mg
$$

- Work is done when a force causes an object to move in the direction of the force.

$$
\begin{align}
    W &= Fs \\
    W &= Fs cos \theta \\
    W &= mgh
\end{align}
$$

- Energy is the capacity to do work.

- Potential energy is the energy stored in the object because of its position or its state.

$$
E_p = mgh
$$

- Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion

$$
E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$

- Principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can be transformed from one form to another but the total energy in a system is constant.

- Power is the rate at which work is done or rate at which energy is transformed

- Engine is a device in which one form of energy is converted into another, usually mechanical energy

$$
\eta = \frac{\text{input}}{\text{output}} \times 100\%
$$

- Elasticity is the property of an object that enables it to return to its original shape and dimensions (size) after an applied external force is removed.

- Hook's Law states that the extension of a spring is directly proportional to the stretching force applied on it provided the elastic limit of the spring is not exceeded

$$
F = kx
$$

- Elastic potential energy is the energy stored in a spring when it is extended or compressed.

$$
E_p = \frac{1}{2}kx^2
$$

$$
E_p = W
$$

- Pressure is the force acting normally on unit area of a surface

$$
P = \frac{F}{A}
$$

- Pressure in liquid

$$
P = h \rho g
$$

- The pressures at two points at the same level in the same liquid are equal

- Pascal's principle (the principle of the transmission of pressure in a liquid)

The pressure exerted on an enclosed liquid is transmitted equally throughout the liquid.

$$
\frac{F_2}{F_1} = \frac{A_2}{A_2}
$$

$$
\frac{F_1}{A_1} = \frac{F_2}{A_2}
$$

- Archimedes' Principle states an object whether completely or partially immersed in a fluid is acted on by a buoyant force, which is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced,

$$
F = \rho V g
$$

- Bernoulli's Principle states that in a steady flow of a fluid, the pressure of the fluid decreases when the velocity of the fluid increases

- The heat capacity of an object is the quantity of head energy required to increase its temperature by 1 degree celcius.

$$
\begin{align}
    Pt &= mc \theta \\
    \frac{1}{2}mv^2 &= mc \theta \\
    mgh &= mc \theta
\end{align}
$$

- The specific latent heat of fusion is the quantity of heat energy required to change 1KG of substance from solid to liquid without the change in temperature.

- Boyle's Law states that the pressure of a fixed mass of gas is inversely proportional to its volume (Temperature is kept constant)

$$
\rho \propto \frac{1}{V}
$$

$$
P_1V_1 = P_2V_2
$$

- Pressure's Law (measure in Kelvin, K)

(with constant V)

$$
P \propto T
$$

$$
\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2}
$$

- Charles' Law (measure in Kelvin, K)

(with constant P)

$$
V \propto T
$$

$$
\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}
$$
