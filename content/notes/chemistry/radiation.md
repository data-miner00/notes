## α-Particles

1. An alpha particle is made up of 2 protons and 2 neutrons
2. It has the same composition of the nucleus of the Helium atom
3. It is positively charged and is represented by $\ce{^4_2He^{2+}}$
4. Has high ionising power

### Examples

α-decay for plutonium-240, $\ce{^{240}Pu}$

$$
\ce{^{240}_{94}Pu -> ^4_2He + ^{236}_{92}U}
$$

## β-Particles

1. β-particles are high energy electrons moving at a speed comparable to the speed of light ($3.0 \times 10^8 ms^{-1}$)
2. Forms when a neutron in the nucleus splits into a proton and an electron
3. Electron is ejected from the nucleus as β-particle

$$
\ce{Neutron -> proton + electron (\beta-particle)}
$$

$$
\ce{^1_0n -> ^1_1H + ^0_{-1}e}
$$

4. Has higher penetrating power compared to α-particle due to small mass and high velocity
5. Can be stopped by a thin sheet of aluminium

### Examples

β-decay for caesium-137

$$
\ce{^{137}_{55}Cs -> ^0_{-1}e + ^{137}_{56}Ba}
$$

## γ-Radiation

1. After emitting α or β-particles, the nucleus of the new element sometimes left in an excited state with excess energy that will be emitted shortly after as γ-radiation.
2. γ-radiation, like X-ray, is high-energy electromagnetic radiation with very short wavelength ($10^{-10}$ to $10^{-12}$ m)
3. Highest ionizing power and penetrating power
4. Can be stopped by think block of lead
5. γ-radiation is neutral and is not affected by electric or magnetic field

### Examples

γ-radiation from excited Plutonium

$$
\ce{Pu^* -> Pu + \gamma \text{ (Excess energy)}}
$$
