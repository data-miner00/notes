The Swedish chemist, Arrhenius proposed the following definition of an acid.

> An acid is a substance which ionises or dissociates in water to produce hydrogen ions, $H^+$.

## Hydrochloric acid

Aqueous hydrochloric acid, $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ is a solution of hydrogen chloride in water. It is obtained by dissolving pure hydrogen chloride gas in water.

$$
\ce{HCl(g) -> HCl(aq)}
$$

As the gas dissolves in water, the hydrogen chloride molecule reacts with water and ionises to produce hydrogen ion, $\ce{H^+}$.

$$
\ce{HCl(aq) -> H^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq)}
$$

The hydrogen ion then attaches itself to a water molecule to form the **hydroxonium ion**, $\ce{H3O^+}$.

$$
\ce{H^+(aq) + H2O(l) -> H3O^+(aq)}
$$

Hence, the overall equation for the ionisation of hydrogen chloride is as follows.

$$
\ce{HCl(aq) + H2O(l) -> H3O^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq)}
$$

For convenience, we will be referring hydroxonium ion as hydrogen ion.

The ionisation of hydrochloric acid in water can be represented as follows.

$$
\ce{HCl(aq) ->[H2O] H^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq)}
$$

Other acids ionise similarly in water.

## Nitric acid

$$
\ce{HNO3(aq) ->[H2O] H^+(aq) + NO3^-(aq)}
$$

The product is hydrogen ion and nitrate ion.

## Sulphuric acid

$$
\ce{H2SO4(aq) ->[H2O] 2H^+(aq) + SO4^{2-}(aq)}
$$

The product is hydrogen ion and sulphate ion.

## Phosphoric acid

$$
\ce{H3PO4(aq) ->[H2O] 3H^+(aq) + PO4^{3-}(aq)}
$$

The product is hydrogen ion and phosphate ion.
