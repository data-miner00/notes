As someone who lives on the equator, season change has been alien to me. There is only summer here and it's pretty hard for me to grasp and remember the intricacies of the different seasons; they are simply non-relatable. However, I've came across the notion of four seasons quite frequently when learning Korean, and it's pretty hard to remember the words without any context in mind.

The orbital tilt, also known as axial tilt, is the phenomena where the Earth does not stay upright when orbiting the sun. There is a ~23.5 degrees slant which causes one part of the hemisphere to receive more sunlight during a period of time and vice versa to opposite hemisphere. The uneven sunlight exposure is what causes the seasons to manifest.

The side that accepts the sunlight the most will be summer and winter for the opposite. Spring and autumn are the transition seasons between the two extreme season.
