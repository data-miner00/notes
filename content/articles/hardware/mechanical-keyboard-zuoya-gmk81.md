I've always wanted a **customized** mechanical keyboard because my current off-the-shelves mechanical keyboard with blue switch and 100% layout has become uncomfortable for me to use. I felt the full-sized layout is a bit clunky to navigate due to extra keys that I rarely use and the sheer mental torture of the clicking sound has been growing in me for quite some time.

## Shopping

Last month, my friend brought me to [MKB Malaysia](https://mkb.gg/) in SS15 Subang Jaya to check out the keyboards. I have no idea what to expect as I didn't know much about nor research on them. I've decided to just go with the flow.

## Components

I've bought Zuoya GMK81 which has a 75% layout (79 keys) and decided to go with linear switch [HMX Lotus](https://mkb.gg/products/hmx-lotus) as it "feels" best for me, albeit a bit expensive than the other options, pricing at RM1.90 per switch. I didn't buy any keycaps as I've already brought 2 sets from Taobao prior to this.

For the record, here are the keycaps that I've bought.

- [Seaweed](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=693375430914)
- [White](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=705695220378)

This is what I've paid for the individual components.

| Item        | Price    |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Zuoya GMK81 | RM269    |
| HMX Lotus   | RM150.10 |
| Keycaps     | ~RM200   |

## Surprise Features

### Mini TV

I know that customize keyboard are cool and all, but really didn't expect it to have a mini screen that can display stats or even images and animations!

### Customizing

There is a custom tool that can customize the TV screen. I went to the vendor's [download page](https://mkb.gg/pages/download-center) and find the corresponding "Image Custom Tool" for my model. It can support both static images or a GIF image.

The tool will convert the GIF image into multiple frames that is transitioned in a set interval (100ms by default).

This is how the Image Custom Tool looks like when I am adding a custom image.

This is so cute!

The stats and image screen can be cycled through <kbd>Fn</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

### Bluetooth

Besides, I am exhilarated when I found out that it actually supports Bluetooth, which I can connect to my PC without wire. Not just convenient, but aesthetic.

To get into Bluetooth pairing mode, hold <kbd>Fn</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> or <kbd>W</kbd> or <kbd>E</kbd> for 3~5 seconds and the Bluetooth indicator on the screen will flicker quickly indicating it is ready for pairing. Note that <kbd>Q</kbd>, <kbd>W</kbd> and <kbd>E</kbd> each represents different Bluetooth channel that allows to connect up to 3 devices concurrently.

### Battery

Of course, to support Bluetooth mode, it needs to have a battery. The timespan for the battery per single charge is very long as it can last for a few days from my experience.

Of course, you will need to turn off the RGB light by <kbd>Fn</kbd> + <kbd>Backspace</kbd> to maximize the timespan.

## Thoughts

I am glad that I have brought the keyboard. I am able to type without getting annoyed anymore, and the unexpected feature makes the price super worth it. I am ecstatic.
